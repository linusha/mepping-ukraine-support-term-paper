# mepping-ukraine-support-term-paper

This repository contains code for my term-paper in the course Bayesian Modelling at the Hertie-School in Summer 2025.

To run the analysis from the ground-up, you'll need to download the data from [here](https://github.com/HowTheyVote/data/releases/tag/2025-04-07) and place it in the `/data` folder.

A `renv.lock` file is contained in the repository to ensure that you have all the packages required in a version compatible with the code.

The `functions.R` file was circulated as part of the course materials and was authored by Sascha Goebel.
